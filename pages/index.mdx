# Welcome to _Dark Javascript_

This is a Javascript style guide, to do things the _dark_ way, which can help make your Javascript code more readable, and or optimized!

It is a simple pocket guide that you can bring up anytime, and look at! It follows Airbnb's amazing Javascript style guide that can be found [here](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#readme), which you can also read.

But a problem I found with it as they went through a lot of great points a little too quickly, so I decided to fix it by talking about the points in much more detail! 

But even if you are scared of me going off track of the style guide, I still follow all the points Airbnb's style guide goes through, so you don't have to worry about it.

Thank you, and I hope you enjoy this Style Guide!
