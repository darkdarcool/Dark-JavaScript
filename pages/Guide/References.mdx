* Use `const`(contants) whenever possible, limit your `var` usage. 

``` javascript 
// Bad >:(
var num1 = 1;
var num2 = 10;

// good :)
const num1 = 1;
const num2 = 10;
```

<Callout>
`let` is also a better keyword than `var`, as it is the same as const(it being only accesible in it's block), except the variable declared with `let` can be edited!
</Callout>

* If you reassing a variables value, make sure to use `let` instead of `var`.

> The reason? `let` is blocked-scoped rather than function scoped
