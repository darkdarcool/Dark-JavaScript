# Types

* **Primitives**: Acessing a primitive and editing it's value

If you wish to use a variables value by copying it's value to another variable, you work directly to it's value like the following:

``` javascript 
const var1 = 1;
let var2 = var1;
var2 = 2;

console.log(var1, var2); // => 1 2
```

* **Complex**: When you assign a variable to another variables with an array as it's data, that variable can then edit the other variables array:

```
const foo = [1, 2];
const bar = foo;

bar[0] = 9;

console.log(foo[0], bar[0]); // => 9, 9
```

<Callout>
  If you wish to copy an array, use a `...` spread like the following: 
  ``` javascript 
  var foo = [1, 2, 3];
  var bar = [...foo]
  bar[0] = 10;
  console.log(foo, bar); // => [ 1, 2, 3 ] [ 10, 2, 3 ]
  ```
</Callout>
